# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Implement a solution to identify a handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ... , 9

### Implementation and Results
* Developed a solution to identify digits from handwritten image samples using:
  * a) Logistic regression model
  * b) Deep neural network with Keras and Tensorflow
  * c) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * d) Random Forest 
  * e) Ensemble Classifier
* Achieved a classification rate of 89% on unseen data using the classical logistic regression model.
* Achieved a classification rate of 98% on unseen data using the deep neural networks. 
* Ensemble Classifier with majority voting achieved an accuracy of 96% on the unseen data.
* Modelled the structure, hyper-parameters and link weights of the neural network using Python.
* Trained the classical regression model and tuned hyper-parameters using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method to determine the appropriate weights and normalization factor.

### Software Used
Python, Keras, Tensorflow
